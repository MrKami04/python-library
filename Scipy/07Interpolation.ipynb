    "# Interpolation?\n",
    "- Interpolation is a method for generating points between given points.\n",
    "- For example: for points 1 and 2, we may interpolate and find points 1.33 and 1.66.\n",
    "- Interpolation has many usage, in Machine Learning we often deal with missing data in a dataset, interpolation is often used to substitute those values.\n",
    "- This method of filling values is called imputation.\n",
    "- Apart from imputation, interpolation is often used where we need to smooth the discrete points in a dataset.\n",
    "#### How to Implement it in SciPy?\n",
    "- SciPy provides us with a module called `scipy.interpolate` which has many functions to deal with interpolation:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1D Interpolation\n",
    "- The function `interp1d()` is used to interpolate a distribution with 1 variable.\n",
    "- It takes `x` and `y` points and returns a callable function that can be called with new `x` and returns corresponding `y`."
